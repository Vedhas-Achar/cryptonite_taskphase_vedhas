# home sweet home

## Procedure
i started the challenge and then connected my terminal. after that, i tried various combination and found that `~` takes me to the end of a file and `/` takes me back... and how many character i specify after `/` will take me back by that many times. in the question it was told that the answer was in home. hence i used `~` to go last and then `/a` to come back to `/home` from which i had already ran `/challenge/run`

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ pwd
/home/hacker
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{Ebr8oWXy5ba4r_v_HXYhbrLkRX2.dNzM4QDLyIDO0czW}`
