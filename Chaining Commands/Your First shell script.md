# Your first shell script

## Procedure
I started the challenge and then connected my terminal<br>
then i created a shell script using `touch x.sh` then i used `echo /challenge/pwn >> x.sh`
and then typed `echo /challenge/college >> x.sh` to append those both in,
then i used `bash x.sh` to get the flag.

## bash
`hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo /challenge/pwn >> x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo /challenge/college >> x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{YsFoGwVzYUgdy_d342OEEpcXcPo.dFzN4QDLyIDO0czW}`
