# The PATH Variable

## Procedure
I started the challenge then connected my terminal<br>
then i changed the path using `PATH=""` and then ran `/challenge/run` and
got the flag which i pasted into the flag box.

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH=""
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: No such file or directory
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!
