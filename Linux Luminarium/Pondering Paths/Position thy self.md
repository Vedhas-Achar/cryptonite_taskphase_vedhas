`hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YLL0PsV-bpJtbJjBmzvxYG3dHDU.dZDN1QDLyIDO0czW}`
