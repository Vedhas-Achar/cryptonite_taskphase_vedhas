# Matching with ?

## Procedure
I started the challenge and then connected the terminal<br>
then i wrote `cd /????????` to get challenge directory, but didnt work.
then got to know u just have to not use c and d, hence then i used `cd /?ha??enge`
i came into the challenge directory and then used `./run`.
i pasted the flag into the flag box.

## bash
`hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /
