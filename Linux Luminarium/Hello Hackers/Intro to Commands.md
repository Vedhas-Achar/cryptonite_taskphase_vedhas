# intro to commands

I first started the challenge, 
After that i went and typed `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college` into my ubuntu terminal. 
After that i got connected to hacker dojo. 
After that i ran the command `hello` into it. 
It ran and gave me the flag, which i pasted it into pwn.college flag box

`hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
