i started the challenge and then connected the terminal<br>
then ran the program in the background using `/challenge/run &` and then
got the flag which i pasted into the flag box.

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &

hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$
Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...
Anyways! Here is your flag!
