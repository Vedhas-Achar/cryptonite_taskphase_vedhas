# Learning Complex Usage

## Procedure
I first started the challenge and connected my terminal. <br>
then i went back to `/` directory and then typed `/challenge/challenge --printfile /challenge/
DESCRIPTION.md` and i got the description of my level. After that i tried a lot of methods
and didnt get the answer, then i asked my friend for help and he told me to use 
`/challenge/challenge --printfile flag` and got the flag.

## bash
`hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:/$ ls
bin   challenge  etc   home  lib32  libx32  mnt  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  dev        flag  lib   lib64  media   nix  proc  run   srv   tmp  var
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:/$ / --printfile flag
ssh-entrypoint: /: Is a directory
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:/$ /challenge/challenge --printfile flag
Correct argument! Here is the flag file:
pwn.college{AnKOpOEJPrl3yWJDDQ2lKrRv_07.dVjM5QDLyIDO0czW}`
