# Setting PATH

## Procedure
I started the challlenge and then connected terminal<br>
then i changed the PATH using `PATH="/challenge/more_commands"` and then i ran
`/challenge/run` and then got the flag, pasted it into the flag.

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH="/challenge/more_commands"
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ win
It looks like 'win' was improperly launched. Don't launch it directly; it MUST
be launched by /challenge/run!
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH="/challenge/more_commands/"
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ win
It looks like 'win' was improperly launched. Don't launch it directly; it MUST
be launched by /challenge/run!
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
