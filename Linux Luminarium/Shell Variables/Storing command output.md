# Storing command output

## Procedure
I started the challenge and then connected my terminal<br>
and then did `PWN=$(/challenge/run)` and got the flag inside `PWN` , then used 
`echo PWN` to get my flag.

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ PWN=$(/challenge/run)
Congratulations! You have read the flag into the PWN variable. Now print it out
and submit it!
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ echo $PWN
pwn.college{85srufTGJQJgW8o-Zk5XcxNAsrH.dVzN0UDLyIDO0czW}`
